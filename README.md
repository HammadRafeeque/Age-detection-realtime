# ðŸ§  Real-Time Age Detection using OpenCV

This project performs real-time age detection using a webcam, OpenCV's deep learning module (`cv2.dnn`), and pre-trained models for face detection and age prediction.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time webcam feed
- Face detection using OpenCV DNN (TensorFlow model)
- Age prediction using pre-trained Caffe model
- Simple, lightweight, and easy to use
